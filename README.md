Game Overview
General Description
Lost in Mazie Mansion is a top-down, horror-puzzle game in which the player is trapped within a mansion and must overcome their fears in order to escape. The player quickly realizes that there are indeed residents within the manion; however, these residents may not be living. In order to get out alive, the player must find items and tools throughout the mansion and solve various puzzles to conquer their fears and eventually escape the mansion. 
Background Story
There’s a mansion in this town. A big one. You can’t miss it. It’s been there for years. Always on sale. Cheap too! No one wants to live there anymore.

The story goes that this mansion wasn’t always like this. Long ago, it started out as a one room house that an elderly couple called home. Once they passed, another family took it. They added a room to the house. When they left, another couple took it. They added some more rooms. And so on.

By the time the fifth family lived in this house, it had grown to a substantial size but was still a functional and recognizable house. They were an odd family, to say the least. There was something about them.

That’s when things got weird.

This family added more rooms, not because they needed the space, but because they felt as though they should keep up with the tradition, or so they said. The rooms, more like areas, they built were, shall we say, warped. Stairways to the roof; doors that led nowhere; rooms with the furniture nailed to the ceiling. Creepy.

Years later, the last remaining member of the family, old and near death, wrote in the deed of the house that anyone who bought the house must add onto it, at least one room. This contract was far more binding than anyone could have ever imagined.

The next family that owned the house did as the deed instructed, seemingly against their will. The room they had built was even more warped than the previous owners’. The couple after them added a long hallway. Too long. Much too long. The next couple put five rooms at the end of this hallway, each more strange than the last. This went on and on. The really strange part was that each person who entered the house left sooner than the previous owners, if they were able to leave at all. Some stayed there, like hermits, until the day they died. No one who entered the house was ever quite the same. It’s almost as if the house was eating them alive.

The house grew and grew in size. And in ominousness. People became increasingly weary of it over the years. The market for it plummeted, along with its price. Yet there were those folks that, for whatever reason, still wanted the house. Then the very last family came.

A couple and their large family were recently hit by the falling market in their home area. Willing to do anything to support them, the father found work in this area. So he packed up the family and moved here. However, in an ironic twist, the only house they could afford was the warped mansion people were now actively avoiding. The price was right and the taxes were low; not even the government was willing to touch this house. They were just grateful to have a roof over their heads at all, as eerie as it was.

They were a poor family and didn’t make much money. They couldn’t afford to add onto the house, as was explained in the deed. They chuckled over why such a ridiculous provision existed in the first place. They stored the deed away and forgot all about it.

They were very pleasant people, always willing to lend a hand to those in need, even though they could barely afford to put food on their own table. As their children grew, they helped out more and more, either by working to earn some money for the family or volunteering. The eldest son was particularly handy, so he fixed up the house to make it more presentable. People began to become less weary of the house. A nice family such as them surely could bring a calm to the ever growing house.

But as they say, no good deed goes unpunished.

No one knows exactly how or why, but one day, everything changed. Their youngest daughter, Mazie, disappeared. There was no evidence of a struggle. There was no evidence of a break in. She was just gone. The case is still cold to this very day.

Mazie was just the beginning.

After that day, some kind of dread wrapped around the house. People slowly stopped coming near it. The family changed. It wasn’t abrupt, but they certainly changed. The father, falling ever deeper into despair, drank his daughter’s disappearance away. The two eldest sons worked dangerous jobs just to help keep the rest of the family above water. They became agitated and aggressive due to the nature of their work, so they say. The entire family stopped volunteering. They became cold, almost lifeless.

The second son eventually snapped. He beat his younger sister, the second daughter, to death, screaming the whole time about adding a place to play music. He never showed any musical affinity before. He was arrested, tried, and convicted, but before they could sentence him, they found him on the floor of his cell, dead. Apparently, he was suffering from a severe brain illness that finally took him.

The eldest son contracted what was officially reported as tuberculosis, though everyone knows that wasn’t the case. He couldn’t breathe. The lack of oxygen and the constant high fever sent him to into a coma. He babbled and babbled about a hall of mirrors. Things like that didn’t exist during his time, so no one could understand where that came from. He too eventually slipped away.

The eldest daughter wanted out of the house badly. She got her chance when her friend invited her over for a birthday party. They went swimming in the pond out back. At the deepest point, the water only reached the bottom of this daughter’s rib cage. And yet, she drowned. Oddly, there were small scratches on her shoulders. Someone, or something, held her under. Her friend said she waded out there by herself after admitting to her that she wished she could have built doors that led outside on the upper floors. What a strange desire.

One by one, family members fell. No one went near them anymore. It became too much for the father to bear. He took the car and left. Two weeks later, they found him in a secluded wooded area with an empty revolver in his hand and a bullet in his head.

The mother went insane.

The details about this last part are sketchy at best. But they say the mother found a poem on the pillow in Mazie’s old room. It read:

I am not dead
I am not alive
Do what it wants
And you might survive

There was a frenzy of activity. Any contractor that was willing started work on the house. Many more rooms, areas, and hallways were added. The house almost doubled in size. Then the construction abruptly stopped. The mother fired all of the contractors. In her hysteria, the towns people saw her run outside and scream at the house, “Are you satisfied!? I’ve given you what you want! Now give them back!” Then she collapsed. Right there on the street. Dead.

The rumors say that it was the house that swallowed Mazie. She tried to find out what the fifth family did to the house. She tried to fix the house. But the house didn’t want to be fixed. It wanted to be feared. She didn’t fear it. So it got rid of her. She was the only thing standing in between the house and her family. And the house simply just swallowed her alive.

Or so they say.

I don’t believe any of that. Sure this “Mazie Mansion” looks creepy, but a house is just a house. An object made of timber and glass. So I’m going to head in and see what this place is all about. I’ll show those cretins who the ‘fraidy cat is!

(Several hours later)

*Wakes up.* Where am I? *Looks around.* A bedroom. How’d I get here? Hmm...let’s see. I entered the house. Wandered around a bit. Then looked out a window on the ground floor near the backyard. It opened up fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. But when I jumped out, I landed back in the house. ...I did, didn’t I? But how? Well, then I tried to leave, but the door was locked. …..Wait, the door was locked. Then a growl. Then nothing. And here I am. What the heck!?

Here’s the story that none of the characters know and that Mazie needs to remember. The fifth family dabbled in the dark arts. They hexed the mansion. They brought in the bad ghosts. And they did it to fulfill a deal made long ago so they could finally be freed of their terror. The house must constantly be fed. Building the house builds its power and satisfies it. Eating those unwilling to feed the house also satisfies it. It will manifest your greatest fears, and the malevolent spirits within join in the thrill. 

But in this madness is the main hall, the original room of the original house. It is terrified of what it has become. And it’s far too small to fight back on its own. But it knows what to do. Each addition has a different meaning, and that meaning was warped by the terror of the mansion. The original room told Mazie what that room meant to the first owners. And Mazie wrote a poem about it. Mazie wandered every hall, every stairway, every door, window, and mirror. She wrote poems to describe the true meaning behind every area; the meaning it should have had, not what is was warped into. There was only one room she couldn’t write - the main entryway. The house, sensing it was in danger, scattered her poems and swallowed her, making her forget everything. Now you, the player, must gather the poems that the house so fears to finally put it to rest.

Determination
Can fall apart in weakness
Even the strong fall

(To make it clear, this indicates that even the best of intentions or strongest and kindest of people can fall apart in times of great weakness, and their actions and motivations may twist. Just like this house. It was meant to protect the people that entered it and make many memories with them. But it was twisted into something much more sinister. It has lost its way and must be found again. It desperately wants to be a good house, but the fear of the hex has consumed it, and it can’t control itself at all.)

Meaning of the Mansion
Mazie’s bedroom. This is where the story begins, in the farthest away room from the front door. Mazie, before she was swallowed, found a way to make all of the bedrooms in the mansion safe from the madness of the mansion. 
The attic. Warped into a place where only the most heinous of ghosts preside, the attic was meant to be an area that housed the fondest of memories.
The main floor kitchen. Warped into a rat and cockroach infested, glutinous gathering spot, this was to be a place were a family could gather and speak freely about their day.
The master balcony. This place stares into the endless void. Void of love. Void of trust. Void of understanding. The master bedroom may be safe, but the attached balcony is anything but welcoming. This balcony was created such that the two love birds who built it could enjoy each other’s company.
The all too long hallway. This addition originally ended in nowhere; a dead end hallway. A way to escape the house, but it still resided within it. This hallway and every room attached to the other side of it don’t actually exist. This was meant to be a way to escape the house; a fire escape to be precise. Once this is learned, this hallway and all attachments will disappear.
The third floor stairway to nowhere. This long stairway goes through several layers, all of which are the same third floor area. It was twisted into a loop that only ends when the climber is ready to give up. The way down is far more perilous. This stairway was meant to go into the room above it, a room with no visible entrance. It was to be a secret hideout and playroom for the children of a past family.
The second floor playroom. Truly a demons playhouse, this room will take away your sanity faster than any other room. These malevolent ghosts love to play tricks. It’s a relatively small room, but it feels endless, like you can’t find your way out. It was meant to be a nursery and playroom for an expecting couple’s new baby.
The hall of mirrors. This room was never meant to exist and appears on the other side of the long hallway. Created out of Mazie’s mother’s madness, this disorienting and ever changing room is full of trickster ghosts. None of the mirrors are actually mirrors, so it is perfectly acceptable to break them, destroying the room.
Music Room C. This room, located in the basement, has a never ending, out of tune, sad drone whining all around it. This room was fashioned out of the original house’s basement. The elderly couple loved calm, cheery music. It was quite a cheerful room, a welcoming place where anyone could find happiness.
Music Room B. This room, located on the second floor, was built by an aspiring classical musician. His work consumed him while he lived in the house, and the room has since warped into a mess of harsh notes and confused melodies. He could have been great, if only his work could see the light of day and be listened to by willing ears.
Music Room A. This room, located in as a separate room in the attic area, was also built by Mazie’s mother’s hysteria. A fervor of frenzied notes bombards anyone who enters it. The ghosts in here are particularly loud. This noise can disorient even the strongest people, making them more prone to hallucinations. The wall that separated this room from the rest of the attic should never have been built. This was a place for memories.
The grand entryway. This double staircase leading from the second floor to the ground floor has become a twisted symbol of power. The house has made this impending stairway even more awesome and terrible. Though a power symbol, it was meant to strike a person with admiration rather than terror.
The basement laundry room. This room, located in a section of the basement, was to be a typical laundry room.  However, the house didn’t like the owner that built this room very much, so it locked the door and made the washing machine overflow, flooding the room and drowning the owner.
Ornate Rooms. There will be several ornate rooms, each having its own style of decor.  Some will have holiday decorations.  Others will be lined with one particular item, such as leaves or bugs nailed to every wall and the ceiling.  The room called “Ornate Room 5” will be located on the second floor on the opposite side of the main mansion to Mazie’s bedroom.  It’s decoration is closet doors.
Gameplay Description
The player will begin in a bedroom somewhere in a very large, maze-like mansion. Disoriented and alone, they will need to find their way out of the house. This house will have many rooms with many random features, including, but not limited to, stairways to nowhere, doors that lead to walls, doors that portal the player to some other room or back to the same door, rooms that are upside down or sideways, invisible floors, holes to the abyss, mirror portals, dark rooms, long erie hallways, rooms in which everything has been miniaturized, rooms in which things have been made much bigger, rooms in which there is no visible door or other means of entry, trap doors, thin ledges near steep drops, and more. In this 2D top-down format, the player will be able to see everything within the immediate room they are in, except in cases where the room is dark or if the player is in a room that extends a very large distance. Since this game is targeted for PC only, the player will use the ‘WASD’ keys to move, the ‘E’ key to interact with items and their environment, the ‘ESC’ key for the pause and quit menu, ‘TAB’ for inventory, left click to equip items from inventory, and ‘F’ to use equipped items. The player will traverse the different parts of the mansion via doors, stairways, portals, windows, and other means.

Eventually, the player will run into the benevolent ghost. The benevolent ghost is the ghost of a little girl trapped in the house, who is also trying to escape. She will be a static non-playable character who will help the player by giving hints. The dialog between the player and the ghost will be shown in dialog boxes and text on the screen. She will also be able to help the player out when certain triggers are activated. For example, when the player interacts with certain parts of the environment, such as a room without a door or a note on the ceiling, the benevolent ghost will help the player obtain the clue or key needed in these scenarios. Environmental interactions and the player’s thoughts will also be shown via textbox. In addition, the benevolent ghost asks for the player’s help to escape the house. The player does this by discovering the secrets of the house. When the player finds a secret, they will receive a “candy,” which they can then give to the benevolent ghost. If the player can find all of the secrets, then the benevolent ghost will be able to escape the house. These secrets will take the form of Mazie’s poems, which will be hidden around the house. Mazie is the benevolent ghost; she just does not realize it yet.

In order to get through the house, the player must solve puzzles. The types of puzzles that the player will need to solve include physical puzzles, mental puzzles, and treasure hunt puzzles. Some physical puzzles may include ordering blocks on a grid, putting a picture together, matching colors, rearranging bookshelves, and following patterns (including music, color, or footprint). The physical puzzles may or may not have instructions or clues, depending on their difficulty. Some mental puzzles may include math or number problems. These also may or may not have hints, depending on the type of problem and the difficulty. The treasure hunt puzzles, by contrast, will have clues in order to find an item or another clue that will guide the player closer to a key. These clues may be notes posted on walls or loose on the ground, carvings in doors, or a statue facing or pointing in a particular direction. For example, there may be a carving of a tooth with fairy wings on a door (indicating the tooth fairy, so look under the pillow), a note that says “I watch my grandchildren and time their play, though I cannot see them.” (a watch is a type of clock, clocks have no eyes, clocks tell time, and a wrist watch could be the ‘grandchild’ of a grandfather clock), etc. These will be intentionally made vague and the difficulty will increase as the game progresses.

The keys that will be received from these puzzles will take many forms, including physical keys that unlock doors, new puzzles to solve, or unconventional keys. The unconventional keys may include items such as a quarter, which would go to a door with a lock that looks like a gumball machine, a sandbag, which could go on top of a button or be swapped with a bust, and a jacket, which would go on a hanger and weigh it down. Also, solving some puzzles may unlock a door (or bookshelf, or uncover a mirror, or etc.) without the need for a physical key.

While the player is trying to escape, malevolent ghosts will be hunting down the player and attempting to impede their progress. The ghosts can scare and attack the player in their own forms. They can also change forms into what the player is afraid of or make the player hallucinate, making them believe they are seeing something they are afraid of. Since they are ghosts, they can’t physically hurt the player, but they can make the player go insane. As such, the player’s “health” will be monitored via a sanity meter. The lower this meter gets, the more violent the scares become. For example, if the player’s sanity meter is full, then the malevolent ghosts and the house will appear as normal. At around 75 percent, the malevolent ghost sightings become more frequent. At around 50 percent, the malevolent ghosts will become more grotesque looking, such as disfigured monsters or rat-spider hybrids, and the chance of entering, say, an infinite loop of the same hallway will increase. At around 25 percent, anything that can fall, like pictures or vases, will fall and shake the screen when they land, monster sightings will become even more frequent, and the monsters will become more grotesque. As the sanity meter drops, player visibility may also drop proportionately. The screen may grow dark patches, shimmers, glitches, or streaks, depending on how low the player’s sanity is.

The player has several fears, which they will need to overcome. For example, they may be afraid of heights, the dark, spiders, bugs, loud noises, blood, death and rot, rats, etc. Certain events will trigger the player to overcome their fears. For example, if the player must walk over a bridge high in the air, they will not be able to unless a particular item, such as blinders, is found. Once the event is triggered, the player may then conquer their fear. As soon as the fear is conquered, it will no longer scare the player. In the height example, once the player crosses the bridge, they will realize that there is nothing to be afraid of, so they will no longer need the blinders to cross the bridge. Also, the malevolent ghosts will not be able to imitate a conquered fear any longer. For example, if the player has conquered their fear of rats, the malevolent ghosts will no longer be able to transform into rats.

The malevolent ghosts can deplete the player’s sanity, but the player may also gain their sanity back. This is accomplished by going to safe zones, which are bedrooms. Ghosts and monsters cannot enter these safe zones. However, if the player is low on sanity and the screen is dark, then the screen will remain dark within the safe zone. When the player interacts with the teddy bear on the bed, they will gain their sanity back. This means that the screen, the house, and the enemies will all go back to normal. In these areas, the player can also save their progress. Additionally, there will be various food items scattered throughout the game that will allow the player to regain some sanity upon eating them.

The player cannot attack the monsters, but they can hide from the monsters in different parts of the environment. Some hiding areas include the underneath of desks, behind bookcases, in plants, in baskets, in holes in the wall, and behind statues. Successfully hiding from a ghost means that the ghost cannot scare or attack the player, so the player’s sanity will be unaffected.

If the player’s sanity decreases to zero before they can reach a safe zone, the player will go insane and be swallowed by the house. A game over screen will show. The game over screen will have two options: continue or quit. The continue button will allow the player to restart from their most recent save point. The quit button will quit to the main menu.
	


Game Specs
Rules
The game has a single goal and winning condition - escaping the mansion. Upon going through the entirety of the game’s story and reaching the end, the player will complete the game. Throughout the game, the player will reach several save points, which will allow the player to save their progress to that point. The primary part of the game that impedes this progress is the player’s sanity meter. The different enemies and environmental hazards found throughout the game will cause the player’s sanity meter to decrease. When this sanity meter is fully depleted, the player will be unable to continue, and must restart from their most recent save point.
Interactions
Throughout the game, the player will run into a variety of things that they will interact with in different ways.
Enemies: Enemies will be found throughout the game, and will try to impede the player’s progress. There are many different levels for each enemy. The main way they will interact with the player is by decreasing their sanity meter in a variety of ways, such as attacking the player directly or causing particular events to occur in the environment.
Items: There will be several key items that can be found and picked up by the player throughout the game. These items will give the player different abilities and allow them to interact with the environment in different ways, such as a flashlight that will light up dark rooms.
Environment/Puzzles: There will be a variety of ways in which the player will interact with the environment throughout the course of the game, such as holes in the floor that will drop them to a different room or a room that is almost completely dark. Additionally, there will be a variety of puzzles where the player must use different items they’ve obtained and problem-solving skills in order to overcome them and continue on.
NPCs: Throughout the game, there will be various non-player characters that the player can interact with and engage in dialogue with, which will either explain parts of the story or provide clues and aid the player.
Mansion: The player will be restricted to interacting with things within the house, and will not be able to leave the mansion by traditional means until they defeat the final boss.

Save/Teddy Bear: The game will perform an auto-save when the player interacts with a teddy bear in any safe area (bedrooms). The player’s sanity will also be fully recovered after interacting with a teddy bear. 
Sanity: The player will have a sanity meter. This is an attribute assigned to the character which depletes when the player comes into contact with the enemies or certain environmental events. In order to prevent losing sanity the player must hide from enemies. Sanity can be recovered if food is consumed or if they interact with the teddy bear in the bedrooms. Upon loss of all sanity, the player will be forced to start over. 
Food/Recovery: The player can obtain food items to recover sanity loss from enemy attack. Food can be found in some locations. 
Candy: The player will obtain candies by discovering the backstory of the house and the benevolent ghost. By giving these candies to the benevolent ghost, she will gradually remember what happened. Once all candies are collected, she can move on. 
Hiding: There are marked locations within many of the rooms where the player may hide in order to avoid coming into contact with the enemies. These locations will have a yellow aura around them.
Avoiding Unkillable Enemies: The player will face various enemies which he/she cannot kill. Making contact with these enemies will cause the player to lose sanity. Some enemies are more fearful than others, which means it is more detrimental to come into contact with these enemies.
Fears: The game will have specific puzzles which will be referred to as fears. These fears include things like heights, monsters, etc. The player must collect objects in order to help them conquer these fears. These items will change the way the player can interact with the environment to get past the section.

Art Style and Characters
The main player character is lost in the house and must find their way out.

First level enemies create no physical harm to players but may act as a roadblock during the gameplay. First level enemies are small and tend to clutter together to form a wall with the intention of preventing players from progressing through gameplay. Players need to either find alternate pathway or use items to clear out the level one enemy. 

Second level enemies will chase and attack the player if they are discovered. Second level enemies vary in sizes and shapes. These enemies may be in different forms but their goal is to attack and make the player go insane. The player can’t fight these level 2 enemies and the only solution is to run and hide from them. 




Third level enemies are the bosses, these enemies are the combination of large amounts of level 2 enemies. The level 3 enemies are large and the player must avoid them. These enemies can only be defeated when the player progresses through the fear system.

The benevolent ghost is not an enemy; the ghost will help the player progress through the game by providing hints and clues for the puzzles. The player can give the ghost special items, called “candies.” These candies are given to the benevolent ghost in order to help her recover her memory. If all candies are collected, the player will be able to help the ghost to escape the mansion. 
User Interface
The following are the user interfaces that will be found throughout the game:
Main Menu: The main menu will include the options ‘Start New Game’, ‘Settings’, and ‘Quit’. 
Start New Game: Starting a new game will allow the player to enter and play from the beginning of the game. This game will not save progress and therefore will always start from the beginning. 
Settings: The settings menu featured within the game will feature two subsections:
Gameplay: Here the user can alter aspects of the game which include:

Game Over Display: The game over display will include the options ‘Continue’ and ‘Quit to Main Menu’.
Continue: Clicking continue will revert the player to their previous save state.
Quit to Main Menu: This option will bring up a confirmation message ensuring that the user wants to be brought back to the Main Menu.
Special Features

The main character’s fears can be found all throughout the mansion. If the player is stuck and needs a hint on how to conquer a certain fear, the player can talk to the benevolent ghost and may receive hints.
Dark
Description: The player will fear the dark and be unable to see anything within the dark area. While within the dark area, the player will slowly lose sanity. In order to conquer this fear, the player must find the flashlight key item. Once this is found, the room will light up, and the player will no longer lose sanity. As soon as this happens, the player will easily be able to find the door to move on to the next area.

Location: Mazie’s bedroom 
Heights 
Description: The player will fear areas in which there is a long sheer drop. When in these areas, the player will be unable to cross without the item. Once the item is found, the player will be able to cross. After crossing once, the player will no longer be afraid of the area and will be able to cross back and forth freely.
Key Item: Under-eye Blinders 
Location: The closet in Ornate Room 5
Creatures (Rats, Spiders, Insects, etc.)
Description: The player is afraid of “creepy crawlies,” including rats, spiders, and insects. The player will not be able to enter areas in which these creatures are present. The malevolent ghosts will also be able to transform themselves into warped versions of these things. If the player encounters this, their sanity will drop faster than if they encountered a normal ghost. In order to access these areas, the player must trap the creatures in a cage. Once this is done, the player will get a good look at the creatures, see that their only gross looking and that there’s nothing to be afraid of, and can then move on. By overcoming this fear, the ghosts can’t scare the player by transforming into these things anymore.
Key Item: Cage
Location: The laundry room
Deja Vu/Memory Loss
Description: This will happen if the player’s sanity is at a certain level during certain parts of the game. This will also happen on the “second floor stairway to nowhere” (see above). Aside from the stairway, this is nothing more than a hallucination. The longer the player stays in the loop, the faster they lose their sanity. If the player can find the right way to go, they will escape the loop. If the player doesn’t know where the escape is, they can look at the video camera that has recorded the hallway. The camera can show only the hallway as it is, not as the player is hallucinating it to be. Therefore, this will allow for a quick escape.
Key Item: Video Camera
Location: The master bedroom balcony
Trypophobia
Description: This is the fear of clusters of holes. It looks a lot like rot and disease. This will show up in some floors and walls throughout the mansion. The player will be able to pass by them, but they will lose sanity. The monsters will also be able to warp into creatures with rotting hole-like pustules. In this form, the monsters can take sanity away much faster. Also, even if the player hides, just by seeing the holes, the player’s sanity will decrease. When the player finds a bag of corks, they must make their way to a particular room in which the ghost provides a large hallucination of this fear. The player must then cork up all of the holes before their sanity runs out. Once the holes are all corked up, the player will compare it to a funny looking hedgehog. Unable to get the cork-hedgehog image out of their head, this phobia will no longer affect the player.
Key Item: Bag of Corks
Location: The kitchen 
Dolls without Eyes
Description: The player will fear an area filled with eyeless dolls. While within the doll area, the player will lose sanity. In order to conquer this fear, the player must find a marker key item. Once this is found, the player will be able to draw eyes on the dolls and no longer lose sanity as a result of seeing the dolls.
Key Item: Marker
Location: Music Room B
Hiding
Throughout the levels, there will be monsters that the player will need to run away and hide from. To accomplish this, there will be a variety of holes and hiding spaces the player can interact with in order to prevent the monster from harming the player’s sanity. Available hiding places will be marked so they can be easily identified.
 
Hiding places:
Holes in the wall
Closets
Bookcases
Underneath tables and desks
Behind statues
Final Boss
The final boss will be a conglomeration of previously encountered and overcome fears. The player must find a way to show that they are no longer afraid of these things and that their fears have been overcome, in which case the boss will be defeated and the player will be allowed to leave the mansion, completing the game (Semester 2 - Fall 2019).
