Based in Houghton, Michigan, Husky Game Development Enterprise (HGD) has been dedicated to producing experienced game developers since 2004. We focus on using professional development tools to give students a leg up in the industry, such as Unity, Blender, and Wwise.

Our mission is to design and develop games for business, education, and fun. We work as an interdisciplinary, student-run Enterprise that fosters productivity, creativity, and effective business practices. Our members work in small teams of four to six people, exploring a wide variety of video game engines and platforms.

HGD has partnered with sponsoring companies to design games. We also get involved with campus events like BonzAI Brawl - an AI programming competition that anyone can partake in. This exciting annual event takes a full year to organize and is put together with the joint effort of HGD and the Women in Computing Sciences organization.

## Game Overview

Lost in Mazie Mansion is a top-down, horror-puzzle game in which the player is trapped within a mansion and must overcome their fears in order to escape. The player quickly realizes that there are indeed residents within the manion; however, these residents may not be living. In order to get out alive, the player must find items and tools throughout the mansion, solve various puzzles to conquer their fears, and eventually escape the mansion.

### Rules

The game has a single goal and winning condition - escaping the mansion. Upon going through the entirety of the game’s story and reaching the end, the player will complete the game. Throughout the game, the player will reach several save points, which will allow the player to save their progress leading up to that point. The primary part of the game that impedes this progress is the player’s sanity meter. Various enemies and environmental hazards found throughout the game will cause the player’s sanity meter to decrease. When this sanity meter is fully depleted, the player will be unable to continue, and must restart from their most recent save point. Once the player has completely escaped the mansions, the credits will roll and the playthrough will be complete.
