Mazie: Yeah, I think so...
Player: I'm trying to find my way around. Do you remember anything that could help?
Mazie: Hmmm...my memory is still fuzzy... I can’t think of anything. Maybe you could find me more candy? I might remember more.

Mazie: Mmm...tasty...thanks again!
Player: No problem. Do you remember anything helpful?
Mazie: Hmm...you might be able to find something helpful in one of the guest bedrooms, though a few of them have been boarded up.
Player: Are there any other ways in?
Mazie: The attic floorboards have always been a bit loose...you might be able to get in from above.
Player: Sounds like an idea. I’ll give it a try.
